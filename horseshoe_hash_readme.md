# shhR - Smale Horseshoe Hash in R

A novel non-cryptographic hash function implementation based on the discrete approximation of Smale's horseshoe map, demonstrating the application of dynamical systems theory to pseudorandom number generation and hashing.

## Innovation & Mathematical Foundation

This implementation represents an **innovative approach to hash function design** by leveraging the chaotic dynamics of the Smale horseshoe map - a fundamental concept in dynamical systems theory known for its mixing properties and sensitive dependence on initial conditions. 

### The Horseshoe Map as a Computational Primitive

The Smale horseshoe map, introduced by Stephen Smale in 1967, is a cornerstone example of chaotic dynamics. This implementation discretizes the continuous horseshoe transformation to create a hash function that inherits the map's key properties:

- **Mixing**: Small changes in input produce large, seemingly random changes in output
- **Stretching and Folding**: The classic "stretch-fold-compress" operation maximizes information spread
- **Chaotic Behavior**: Provides natural avalanche effect essential for good hashing

### Novel Application to PRNGs and Hashing

While horseshoe maps are well-studied in mathematical chaos theory, **their systematic application to pseudorandom number generation and hash function design represents a significant innovation**. This work bridges:

- **Pure Mathematics**: Dynamical systems and chaos theory
- **Applied Computer Science**: Hash functions and PRNG design
- **Computational Efficiency**: Discrete operations suitable for digital implementation

The approach opens new avenues for:
- **Chaos-based cryptographic primitives**
- **Novel PRNG architectures** with theoretical foundations in dynamical systems
- **Alternative hash function families** beyond traditional algebraic constructions

## How It Works

### Core Algorithm

The hash function operates through discrete horseshoe transformations:

1. **Initialization**: Convert input string to (x,y) coordinates in discrete space
2. **Iterative Transformation**: Apply horseshoe rounds with stretch, compress, and fold operations
3. **Output Generation**: Combine final coordinates into hash value

### Mathematical Operations

Each horseshoe round implements:
```
x' = (floor(x * stretch)) mod m
y' = (floor(y / compress)) mod m

// Folding operation (creates horseshoe shape)
if x' >= m/2:
    x' = m - x' - 1
```

### Parameterization

The algorithm exposes key parameters for optimization:
- **Stretch factor**: Controls x-dimension expansion (default: 3)
- **Compression factor**: Controls y-dimension contraction (default: 2)
- **Rounds**: Number of horseshoe iterations (default: 4)
- **Modulus**: Output space size (default: 2^16)

## Key Functions

- `string_to_xy(s, mod)`: Convert string to initial coordinates using polynomial hash
- `horseshoe_round(x, y, mod, stretch, compress)`: Single horseshoe transformation
- `horseshoe_hash(s, rounds, mod, stretch, compress)`: Complete hash function

## Example Usage

```r
source("horseshoe_hash.R")

# Basic hashing
horseshoe_hash("hello")
# Output: Integer hash value

# Customized parameters
horseshoe_hash("hello", rounds=6, mod=2^20, stretch=5, compress=3)

# Demonstrate avalanche effect
inputs <- c("hello", "hellp", "world", "worlD")
hashes <- sapply(inputs, horseshoe_hash)
data.frame(Input = inputs, Hash = hashes)

# Parameter sensitivity analysis
test_string <- "cryptography"
rounds_test <- sapply(1:8, function(r) horseshoe_hash(test_string, rounds=r))
stretch_test <- sapply(2:6, function(s) horseshoe_hash(test_string, stretch=s))
```

## Research Applications

### Chaos-Based PRNG Design

This implementation serves as a foundation for developing **chaos-based pseudorandom number generators**:

```r
# PRNG using horseshoe dynamics
horseshoe_prng <- function(seed, n, mod=2^32) {
  coords <- string_to_xy(as.character(seed), mod)
  x <- coords[1]; y <- coords[2]
  results <- numeric(n)
  
  for(i in 1:n) {
    coords <- horseshoe_round(x, y, mod)
    x <- coords[,1]; y <- coords[,2]
    results[i] <- bitwXor(x, bitwShiftL(y, 16)) %% mod
  }
  return(results)
}
```

### Statistical Analysis Framework

```r
# Analyze distribution properties
analyze_distribution <- function(hash_func, samples=10000) {
  # Generate test samples
  test_inputs <- sapply(1:samples, function(i) paste0("test", i))
  hashes <- sapply(test_inputs, hash_func)
  
  # Statistical tests
  list(
    mean = mean(hashes),
    variance = var(hashes),
    uniformity = ks.test(hashes, "punif")$p.value,
    collision_rate = 1 - length(unique(hashes))/length(hashes)
  )
}
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Computational Complexity
- **Time**: O(r) where r is number of rounds
- **Space**: O(1) constant memory usage
- **Parallelizable**: Each coordinate can be processed independently

### Quality Metrics
- **Avalanche Effect**: Small input changes cause large output changes
- **Distribution**: Approximates uniform distribution over output space
- **Collision Resistance**: Depends on modulus size and round count

## Theoretical Properties

### Dynamical Systems Perspective

The hash function inherits properties from the underlying horseshoe map:
- **Topological Mixing**: Ensures good bit diffusion
- **Sensitive Dependence**: Provides avalanche effect
- **Ergodicity**: Statistical uniformity over long sequences

### Comparison with Traditional Hashes

Unlike algebraic hash functions (polynomial, multiplicative), this approach:
- Leverages **geometric transformation** rather than arithmetic operations
- Provides **theoretical foundation** in chaos theory
- Offers **tunable parameters** based on dynamical properties

## Research Directions

### Extensions and Variations
- **3D Horseshoe**: Extend to higher-dimensional chaos
- **Adaptive Parameters**: Dynamic stretch/compress based on input properties  
- **Coupled Maps**: Multiple interacting horseshoe systems
- **Quantum Variants**: Quantum chaos applications

### Applications Beyond Hashing
- **Stream Ciphers**: Chaos-based encryption primitives
- **Digital Signatures**: Novel mathematical foundations
- **Monte Carlo Methods**: High-quality pseudorandom sequences
- **Network Security**: Distributed hash table applications
