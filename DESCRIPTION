Description: We use Smale's horseshoe map (diffeomorphism) to create a non-cryptographic hash using the general principles of sensitivty to initial conditions. Additionally, we show 
illustrative plots for how neighbouring points diverge in a bounded, chaotic manner due to the diffeomorphic nature of the horseshoe map and visualise where neighbouring points get
situated on the initial square after many stretch-compress rounds of appyling the map.
